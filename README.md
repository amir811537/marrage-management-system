--------------------------------------------------Task Description:----------------------------------------------------

    
    Design the Homepage:
         Create an attractive and unique homepage design that includes a navbar, a slider, services section, and footer. Ensure that the design represents the selected event type (Elegant White Roses,Rustic Barn Venue,Crystal Clear Centerpieces etc) and provides a pleasant user experience.

    Implement Authentication and User Profiles:
         Develop the user registration and login pages with email and password-based authentication. Display appropriate error messages for password criteria and email matching errors. Upon successful login or registration, show a toast/alert. Also, implement at least one additional login option, such a Google login. After logging in, ensure the user's name, profile picture, and a logout button appear in the header.

    Service Detail Pages:
         Create service detail pages for the event services offered on your website. These pages should include detailed information about each service. Implement protected routes so that only logged-in users can access these pages. If a user is not logged in, they should be redirected to the login page. Add navigation buttons on the service pages to return to the homepage or other relevant sections.

    Additional Private Routes:
        Add two more private routes to your website, each related to the chosen event type. These routes can include features like event booking, customer reviews, event scheduling, or any other functionality that enhances the user's experience and is relevant to your event management theme.

    Make the Website Responsive:
     Ensure that your website is responsive and displays correctly on various devices, including desktop and mobile. Implement responsive design principles to make the site user-friendly on different screen sizes. Test the website's functionality and appearance on multiple devices to provide a seamless experience for all users.
